# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds comprehensive two-factor authentication (2FA) to the AR Studios CRM system using OTP (One-Time Password) verification via email. The system is designed to be secure, user-friendly, and seamlessly integrated with the existing authentication flow.

## Features Implemented

### 1. OTP Verification via Email
- **6-digit OTP generation** using cryptographically secure random numbers
- **Email delivery** with professional HTML templates
- **60-second expiration** for enhanced security
- **One-time use** - OTPs are automatically invalidated after use

### 2. OTP Expiration & Resend
- **60-second validity period** with real-time countdown timer
- **Resend functionality** after expiration
- **Maximum 3 attempts** before OTP becomes invalid
- **Automatic cleanup** of expired OTPs

### 3. Bootstrap Modal for OTP Input
- **Clean, modern design** matching the existing UI
- **No header/footer** - body-only modal as requested
- **Real-time validation** and error handling
- **Responsive design** for desktop and mobile
- **Auto-formatting** of OTP input (numbers only)

### 4. Security Best Practices
- **Hashed OTP storage** using SHA-256
- **Redis-based temporary storage** with automatic expiration
- **Session-based user tracking** during verification
- **Rate limiting** through attempt counting
- **Secure email templates** with professional styling

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Components

#### 1. OTP Service (`otp_service.py`)
```python
class OTPService:
    - generate_otp(): Creates secure 6-digit codes
    - hash_otp(): SHA-256 hashing for secure storage
    - store_otp(): Redis storage with TTL
    - verify_otp(): Secure verification with attempt tracking
    - send_otp_email(): Professional HTML email delivery
```

#### 2. Database Schema Updates (`models.py`)
```python
# New fields added to User model:
otp_verified = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)
otp_verified_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=True)
two_factor_enabled = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=True)
```

#### 3. Authentication Routes (`auth_routes.py`)
- **Enhanced login flow** with 2FA integration
- **Registration verification** for new users
- **OTP verification endpoint** with JSON API support
- **Resend OTP functionality** with rate limiting

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Bootstrap Modal
- **Responsive design** with consistent styling
- **Real-time countdown timer** (60 seconds)
- **Auto-formatting input** (numbers only)
- **Loading states** and error handling
- **Resend functionality** with visual feedback

#### 2. JavaScript Integration
- **AJAX-based verification** for seamless UX
- **Real-time validation** and error display
- **Timer management** with automatic resend enablement
- **Toast notifications** for user feedback

#### 3. CSS Styling (`static/css/auth.css`)
- **Consistent design language** with existing system
- **Responsive breakpoints** for mobile devices
- **Smooth animations** and transitions
- **Professional color scheme** matching brand colors

## Integration Points

### 1. Login Flow
```
User enters credentials → Password validation → 2FA check → 
OTP sent via email → Modal appears → User enters OTP → 
Verification → Login completion
```

### 2. Registration Flow
```
User fills form → Account creation → OTP sent via email → 
Modal appears → User enters OTP → Email verification → 
Registration completion
```

### 3. Security Flow
```
OTP generation → Secure hashing → Redis storage (60s TTL) → 
Email delivery → User input → Verification → 
One-time use → Automatic cleanup
```

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Redis Configuration
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379

# Email Configuration
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@arstudios.com
```

### Dependencies Added
```
redis==5.0.1
```

## User Experience

### 1. Login Process
1. User enters email and password
2. System validates credentials
3. If 2FA enabled, OTP modal appears automatically
4. User receives email with 6-digit code
5. User enters code in modal
6. System verifies and completes login

### 2. Registration Process
1. User fills registration form
2. Account is created but not fully activated
3. OTP modal appears automatically
4. User receives verification email
5. User enters code to complete registration
6. Account is fully activated

### 3. Error Handling
- **Invalid OTP**: Clear error messages with retry option
- **Expired OTP**: Automatic resend button activation
- **Network errors**: Graceful fallback with user notification
- **Rate limiting**: Clear messaging about attempt limits

## Security Features

### 1. OTP Security
- **Cryptographically secure** random generation
- **SHA-256 hashing** for storage
- **One-time use** with automatic invalidation
- **Time-based expiration** (60 seconds)

### 2. Rate Limiting
- **Maximum 3 attempts** per OTP
- **Automatic lockout** after failed attempts
- **Resend cooldown** to prevent abuse

### 3. Session Security
- **Temporary session storage** for pending verification
- **Automatic cleanup** after completion
- **No persistent OTP storage** in database

## Mobile Responsiveness

### 1. Modal Design
- **Full-screen on mobile** for better usability
- **Touch-friendly inputs** with proper sizing
- **Responsive typography** for readability

### 2. Input Optimization
- **Numeric keypad** on mobile devices
- **Auto-formatting** for better UX
- **Large touch targets** for buttons

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Functional Testing
- Test OTP generation and delivery
- Verify expiration handling
- Test resend functionality
- Validate error scenarios

### 2. Security Testing
- Test rate limiting
- Verify OTP one-time use
- Test session security
- Validate cleanup processes

### 3. User Experience Testing
- Test on different devices

- Validate error messages

## Deployment Notes

### 1. Redis Setup
```bash
# Install Redis
sudo apt-get install redis-server

# Start Redis service
sudo systemctl start redis-server
sudo systemctl enable redis-server
```

### 2. Email Configuration

- Track email delivery rates
- Monitor OTP verification success rates

### 2. Cleanup
- Redis automatically handles OTP expiration
- No manual cleanup required
- Monitor for any stuck sessions

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Additional 2FA Methods
- SMS-based OTP
- Authenticator app integration
- Hardware security keys

### 2. Advanced Security
